## About me

Orginally from Jersey in the Channel Islands and my first jobs were as deckhand on a lobster boat and oyster farm. 

I went to high school at Atlantic College in South Wales and graduated in Marine Biology and Oceanography with Honours from Bangor University in North Wales. 

I worked in Chile at the Universidad de la Santisima Concepcion for my Honours project on macroinvertebrate fauna associated with museel beds. 

After university I worked for 6 months with the Royal Geographical Society in Mauritius on the Shoals of Capricorn marine research program in the St. Brandon Archipelago and on the island of Rodrigues. I then worked as a research assistant at the Leigh Marine Laboratory of the University of Auckland where I completed my PhD thesis on how reef associated predators (rock lobster and pink snapper) feed on soft sediment fauna, supervised by [Marti Anderson](http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/expertise/profile.cfm?stref=204040 "Marti Anderson") and [Russ Babcock](https://theconversation.com/profiles/russ-babcock-126401 "Russ Babcock"). I also worked with [Bill Ballantine](https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/no-take-zone/ "Bill Ballantine") who was responsible for establishing the first no-take marine reserves in New Zealand. 


During my PhD I was involved in the monitoring of fish and lobster populations inside and outside marine reserves in both New Zealand and New Caledonia, and piloted stereo baited video equipment, borrowed from [Dianne McLean](https://uwamegfisheries.github.io/academics/dianne-mclean/ "Dianne McLean") and Euan Harvey [Euan Harvey](https://theconversation.com/profiles/euan-harvey-11039 "Euan Harvey") at the University of Western Australia. 

This led me over to Perth, where I worked with [Jessica Meeuwig](http://www.meeuwig.org/current-members/jessica-meeuwig/ "Jessica Meeuwig") and Euan Harvey on the Securing Marine Futures project. I then undertook a post-doc with the [West Australian Marine Science Institute](https://www.wamsi.org.au/home "WAMSI") developing monitoring approaches to disentangle the effects of global warming and fishing. I then took up a reserach and teaching postion at UWA.
