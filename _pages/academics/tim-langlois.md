## About me

I am orginally from Jersey in the Channel Islands and my first jobs were as deckhand on a lobster boat and an oyster farm. I went to high school at Atlantic College in South Wales and graduated in Marine Biology and Oceanography with Honours from Bangor University in North Wales. I worked in Chile at the Universidad de la Santisima Concepcion for my Honours project on macroinvertebrate fauna associated with museel beds. After university I worked for 6 months with the Royal Geographical Society in Mauritius on the Shoals of Capricorn marine research program in the St. Brandon Archipelago and on the island of Rodrigues. I then worked as a research assistant at the Leigh Marine Laboratory of the University of Auckland where I completed my PhD thesis on how reef associated predators (rock lobster and pink snapper) feed on soft sediment fauna, supervised by Marti Anderson and Russ Babcock. I also worked with Bill Ballantine who was responsible for establishing the first no-take marine reserves in New Zealand. During my time at Leigh I was also involved in the monitoring of fish and lobster populations inside and outside marine reserves, and collected benchmark data for a very large coastal marine reserve proposed off Great Barrier Island and piloted baited video methods in New Caledonia. To conduct this work I borrowed stereo baited video equipment from Dianne McLean and Euan Harvey at the University of Western Australia. This led me over to Perth, where I worked with Jessica Meeuwig and Euan Harvey on the Securing Marine Futures project. I then undertook a post-doc with the West Australian Marine Science Institute developing monitoring approaches to disentangle the effects of global warming and fishing. I then took up a reserach and teaching postion at UWA.
