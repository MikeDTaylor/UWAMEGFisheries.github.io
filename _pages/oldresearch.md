<h2 class="researchtitle">Global Data synthesis</h2>
In contrast to well developed structures for physical and chemical ocean data, tools for the synthesis of macro-ecological data relevant to conservation and fisheries management are not so well developed. To rectify this we have devised and implemented cloud infrastructure to collate and synthesise global marine ecological data [(GlobalArchive)](globalarchive.org). This initiative has now been supported in Australia by [Integrated Marine Observing System](http://imos.org.au/home/) (IMOS), the [National Environmental Science Programme](http://www.environment.gov.au/science/nesp) (NESP) and [National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources](https://nectar.org.au/) (NECTAR), and this year we will be further developing work under the [National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy](https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris) (NCRIS). Internationally we are collaborating with the [GlobalFinPrint project](https://globalfinprint.org/) and [Paul G. Allen Philanthropies](http://www.pgaphilanthropies.org/) to coordinate with comparable global initiatives.

<h2 class="researchtitle">Governance and reporting tools for policy makers</h2>
Spatial management is commonly used in marine systems, and all Australian state agencies tasked with conservation and fisheries management are now using [(GlobalArchive)](globalarchive.org) to organise and synthesise national data sets into a series of in progress high-impact manuscripts. Importantly, this allows matching macro-ecological data with physical and chemical data at the ocean scale. In addition, the current [(NCRIS)](https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris) funding will be used to develop macro-ecological reporting tools designed for communication with policy makers and stakeholders. 

<h2 class="researchtitle">Research to inform emerging management issues - shark depredation</h2>
<img class="philprofile" src='/images/1_interview.png' align='right' width="300" hspace="20" vspace="20">
Shark depredation is a controversial issue locally and internationally. We initiated the first research programme in Australia into shark depredation in a recreational fishery. We also formed an advisory panel including the DBCA, DPIRD, WAFIC and RecFishWest, to supervise the development of this project, leading to the implementation of a science communication strategy that has resulted in balanced media coverage for the first publication. An MSc and PhD student on this project have so far received funding from the Jock Clough Marine Foundation, and both the Recreational Fishing Initiatives Fund for Western Australia and New South Wales and Parks Australia.
 

<h2 class="researchtitle">Standard Operating Procedures and Technology innovation</h2>
Through NESP, we have lead the development of the SOP for stereo-Baited Remote Underwater Video (stereo-BRUV) methods, an established technology for non-destructive monitoring of spatial management used by all state and federal agencies and an emerging method for fisheries independent assessments. We have worked with stereo-BRUV methods for many years, and published a range of methodological studies. We have developed methods and workflows to validate data derived from stereo-video annotation software, which are being used nationally and internationally and are freely available to the research community via [Tim Langlois's GitHub](https://github.com/TimLanglois). In addition, together with our collaborators we have demonstrated an automated and georeferenced stereo-BRUV system that can be deployed during standard commercial fishing practices and can decrease the cost of data collection by 50%. 
  
   
    
<h2 class="researchtitle">Research with the fishing industry</h2>
<img class="philprofile" src='/images/1_Lobster.png' align='right' width="375" hspace="20" vspace="20">
[Tim Langlois's](https://uwamegfisheries.github.io/academics/tim-langlois/) PhD revealed that predation by rock lobster can control the abundance of soft-sediment infauna adjacent to rocky reefs. In collaboration with DPIRD-Fisheries and fishers, Tim is the Principal Investigator on a Fisheries Research Development Corporation (FRDC) funded project to investigate low-catch rates within nursery areas at the centre of the fishery. The MEG lab is also invloved in another two FRDC funded projects, the first with DPRID-Fisheries to investigate lobster catchability and the second with Prof Chari Pattiaratchi to establish a strong current warning system. These projects represent excellent research training opportunities for postgraduate students. We have also been invited to sit on the organising committee for the 12th International Conference and Workshop on Lobster Biology and Management, to be held in Perth in 2020 and that will provide an excellent opportunity for raising the profile of UWA in meeting the needs of the Blue Economy agenda. 
 
 
<h2 class="researchtitle">The effects of fishing on ecosystem processes and informing third party certification of fisheries</h2>
we have made significant contributions to studying the direct and indirect impacts of fishing on ecosystem processes across large biogeographic scales, which have been used to inform marine spatial planning and management. Third-party certification schemes are now seen as the gold standard for commercial fishers and essential for accessing premium markets. The Western rock lobster fishery was the first in the world to receive Marine Stewardship Certification and we have led ecosystem process research vital to ensuring continued certification.
 
 
<h2 class="researchtitle">Fisheries modeling and decommissioning</h2>
In collaboration with the DPIRD-Fisheries we have two high-impact manuscripts in progress that detail and predict the positive implications of a large (2450 km2) fishery closure on the northwest shelf of Australia for fisheries management. With colleagues at UWA we are investigating the impact of subsea oil and gas infrastructure on fish and fisheries, including examination of their role as  potential defacto closed areas. This research informs decommissioning strategies and has helped cement UWA as the leading university for decommissioning marine science research.
 
 
<h2 class="researchtitle">Marine extremes</h2>
<img class="philprofile" src='/images/1_Extremes.png' align='right' width="300" hspace="20" vspace="20">
Our early work in WA described patterns of distribution in marine ecological communities along the coast which were strongly correlated with temperature regimes, and contrasted with global trends demonstrating less consistency. These studies provided an important benchmark from which to investigate the impact of the marine heatwaves of 2010 onwards. We collaborate closely with [Dr Thomas Wernberg](https://wernberglab.org/) and currently co-supervise three students investigating further marine ecological impacts of these marine extremes.
 
 
<h2 class="researchtitle">Aquaculture innovation</h2>
Developing aquaculture in Western Australia is challenging due to low levels of primary productivity. However, in collaboration with DPIRD-Fisheries we are supervising a PhD student to trial a novel and low-cost method for tropical lobster culture, a species for which there is currently no commercial fishery. The student comes with 20 years experience in the aquaculture industry overseas. The novel approach we are testing has the potential to provide a sustainable income and protein source with a low-tech design ideal for development projects across the Indian Ocean and the globe, providing an excellent Blue Economy case study.
 
  
 <h2 class="researchtitle">Developing novel applications of statistical theory</h2>
We have applied novel methods to comparing body-size distributions. Working with students we have developed novel metrics of the effects of fishing based on fish body-size and behaviour, and contributed to a submitted manuscript lead by Rebecca Fisher of AIMS that developed R functions for conducting full sub-set multiple regression. We have a strong statistical emphasis in student supervision and demonstrate the importance of reproducible research.
 
<h2 class="researchtitle">Using socio-economic assessments to inform spatial management policy</h2>
<img class="philprofile" src='/images/1_Marinepark.png' align='right' width="375" hspace="10" vspace="10">
Spatial management policy development has historically been slowed by the perceived widespread opposition of recreational fishers. One of our PhD students has recently submitted a manuscript to Marine Policy that demonstrates that support for spatial management amongst recreational fishers is in fact high and increases with time. This research has been presented by this student to policy makers in Darwin and Canberra and provides a case-study of strategic leadership and we have received a request for further information from the Prime Ministerâ€™s office.
