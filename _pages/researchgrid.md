<h2 class="researchtitle">Fisheries modeling and decommissioning</h2>
In collaboration with the DPIRD-Fisheries we have two high-impact manuscripts in progress that detail and predict the positive implications of a large (2450 km2) fishery closure on the northwest shelf of Australia for fisheries management. With colleagues at UWA we are investigating the impact of subsea oil and gas infrastructure on fish and fisheries, including examination of their role as  potential defacto closed areas. This research informs decommissioning strategies and has helped cement UWA as the leading university for decommissioning marine science research.
 
 
<h2 class="researchtitle">Marine extremes</h2>
<img class="philprofile" src='/images/1_Extremes.png' align='right' width="300" hspace="20" vspace="20">
Our early work in WA described patterns of distribution in marine ecological communities along the coast which were strongly correlated with temperature regimes, and contrasted with global trends demonstrating less consistency. These studies provided an important benchmark from which to investigate the impact of the marine heatwaves of 2010 onwards. We collaborate closely with [Dr Thomas Wernberg](https://wernberglab.org/) and currently co-supervise three students investigating further marine ecological impacts of these marine extremes.
 
 
<h2 class="researchtitle">Aquaculture innovation</h2>
Developing aquaculture in Western Australia is challenging due to low levels of primary productivity. However, in collaboration with DPIRD-Fisheries we are supervising a PhD student to trial a novel and low-cost method for tropical lobster culture, a species for which there is currently no commercial fishery. The student comes with 20 years experience in the aquaculture industry overseas. The novel approach we are testing has the potential to provide a sustainable income and protein source with a low-tech design ideal for development projects across the Indian Ocean and the globe, providing an excellent Blue Economy case study.
 
  
 <h2 class="researchtitle">Developing novel applications of statistical theory</h2>
We have applied novel methods to comparing body-size distributions. Working with students we have developed novel metrics of the effects of fishing based on fish body-size and behaviour, and contributed to a submitted manuscript lead by Rebecca Fisher of AIMS that developed R functions for conducting full sub-set multiple regression. We have a strong statistical emphasis in student supervision and demonstrate the importance of reproducible research.
 
<h2 class="researchtitle">Using socio-economic assessments to inform spatial management policy</h2>
<img class="philprofile" src='/images/1_Marinepark.png' align='right' width="375" hspace="10" vspace="10">
Spatial management policy development has historically been slowed by the perceived widespread opposition of recreational fishers. One of our PhD students has recently submitted a manuscript to Marine Policy that demonstrates that support for spatial management amongst recreational fishers is in fact high and increases with time. This research has been presented by this student to policy makers in Darwin and Canberra and provides a case-study of strategic leadership and we have received a request for further information from the Prime Ministerâ€™s office.
