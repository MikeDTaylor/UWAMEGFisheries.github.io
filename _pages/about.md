<p><center>We are a group of researchers at the University of Western Australia, dedicated to better understanding fish assemblages and lobster populations mainly along the coast of Western Australia, although our work extends to other areas of the Pacific such as New Caledonia and Fiji. Our main focus is in the use of stereo-video techniques to survey marine benthic and pelagic systems, gathering very precise data on fish abundance, population size structure and habitat associations of a variety of species, from site attached pomacentrids to pelagic scombrids.</center></p> 
<p><center>We then use such data to create models that can help us better understand community structure and ecological relationships, and assess impacts of resource use and protection measures. The group has also created strong links with both government and non-government organisations to broaden the spectrum of action of our activities. We now use camera systems on lobster traps and work with lobster fishermen to assist in monitoring abundance, size structure and reproductive capacity of lobster stocks in Western Australia.</center></p>
