Spatial management policy development has historically been slowed by the perceived widespread opposition of recreational fishers. One of our PhD students has recently submitted a manuscript to Marine Policy that demonstrates that support for spatial management amongst recreational fishers is in fact high and increases with time. This research has been presented by this student to policy makers in Darwin and Canberra and provides a case-study of strategic leadership and we have received a request for further information from the Prime Ministerâ€™s office.
