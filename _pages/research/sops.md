Through the National Environmental Science Program, we have lead the development of an Australia wide Standard Operating Procedure for Baited Remote Underwater stereo-Video methods, an established methodology for non-destructive monitoring of of fish populations used by all state and federal agencies. We have worked with stereo-BRUV methods for many years, and published a range of methodological studies. We have developed methods and workflows to validate data derived from stereo-video annotation software, which are being used nationally and internationally and are freely available to the research community via [Tim Langlois's GitHub](https://github.com/TimLanglois). In addition, together with our collaborators we have demonstrated an automated and georeferenced stereo-BRUV system that can be deployed during standard commercial fishing practices and can decrease the cost of data collection by 50%.
