Through NESP, we have lead the development of the SOP for stereo-Baited Remote Underwater Video (stereo-BRUV) methods, an established technology for non-destructive monitoring of spatial management used by all state and federal agencies and an emerging method for fisheries independent assessments. We have worked with stereo-BRUV methods for surveying fish assemblages for over 18 years, and published a range of methodological studies. We have developed methods and workflows to validate data derived from stereo-video annotation software, which are being used nationally and internationally and are freely available to the research community via Tim Langlois GitHub. In addition, together with our collaborators we have demonstrated an automated and georeferenced stereo-BRUV system that can be deployed during standard commercial fishing practices and can decrease the cost of data collection by 50%. This manuscript was recently submitted to the Journal of Applied Ecology.
