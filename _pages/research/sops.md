Through NESP, we have lead the development of the SOP for stereo-Baited Remote Underwater Video (stereo-BRUV) methods, an established technology for non-destructive monitoring of spatial management used by all state and federal agencies and an emerging method for fisheries independent assessments. I have worked with stereo-BRUV methods for surveying fish assemblages for over 18 years, and published a range of methodological studies8-10,18,20-21,25-27,30,38-39. I have developed methods and workflows to validate data derived from stereo-video annotation software30, which are being used nationally and internationally and are freely available to the research community via my GitHub. In addition, my collaborators and I have demonstrated an automated and georeferenced stereo-BRUV system that can be deployed during standard commercial fishing practices and can decrease the cost of data collection by 50%. This manuscript was recently submitted to the Journal of Applied Ecology.
