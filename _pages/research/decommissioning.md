In collaboration with the DPIRD-Fisheries we have two high-impact manuscripts in progress that detail and predict the positive implications of a large (2450 km2) fishery closure on the northwest shelf of Australia for fisheries management. With colleagues at UWA we are investigating the impact of subsea oil and gas infrastructure on fish and fisheries, including examination of their role as  potential defacto closed areas. This research informs decommissioning strategies and has helped cement UWA as the leading university for decommissioning marine science research.
