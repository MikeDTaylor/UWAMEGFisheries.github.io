Shark depredation is a controversial issue locally and internationally. We initiated the first research programme in Australia into shark depredation in a recreational fishery. We also formed an advisory panel including the DBCA, DPIRD, WAFIC and RecFishWest, to supervise the development of this project, leading to the implementation of a science communication strategy that has resulted in balanced media coverage for the first publication.  [Harry Carmody (MSc)](https://uwamegfisheries.github.io/students/harry-carmody/) and [Jonathon Mitchell (PhD)](https://uwamegfisheries.github.io/students/jonathon-mitchell/) have so far received funding from the Jock Clough Marine Foundation, and both the Recreational Fishing Initiatives Fund for Western Australia and New South Wales and Parks Australia.
