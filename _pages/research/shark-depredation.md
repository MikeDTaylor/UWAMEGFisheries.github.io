Shark depredation is a controversial issue locally and internationally. I initiated the first research programme in Australia into shark depredation in a recreational fishery. I also formed an advisory panel including the DBCA, DPIRD, WAFIC and RecFishWest, to supervise the development of this project, leading to the implementation of a science communication strategy that has resulted in balanced media coverage for the first publication47. An MSc and PhD student on this project have so far received funding from the Jock Clough Marine Foundation, and both the Recreational Fishing Initiatives Fund for Western Australia and New South Wales and Parks Australia ($160K).
