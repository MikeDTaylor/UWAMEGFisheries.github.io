Spatial management is commonly used in marine systems, and all Australian state agencies tasked with conservation and fisheries management are now using [(GlobalArchive)](globalarchive.org) to organise and synthesise national data sets into a series of in progress high-impact manuscripts. Importantly, this allows matching macro-ecological data with physical and chemical data at the ocean scale. In addition, the current [(NCRIS)](https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris) funding will be used to develop macro-ecological reporting tools designed for communication with policy makers and stakeholders.
