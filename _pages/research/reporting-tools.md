Spatial management is commonly used in marine systems, and all Australian state agencies tasked with conservation and fisheries management are now using globalarchive.org to organise and synthesise national data sets into a series of in progress high-impact manuscripts. Importantly, this allows matching macro-ecological data with physical and chemical data at the ocean scale. In addition, the current NCRIS funding will be used to develop macro-ecological reporting tools designed for communication with policy makers and stakeholders. 
 implemented cloud infrastructure, using seed funding from the Emerging Leaders grant from the Oceans Institute, to collate and synthesise global marine ecological data (globalarchive.org). This initiative has now been supported in Australia by IMOS, the National Environmental Science Programme (NESP) and NECTAR, and this year I will be managing $220k of further development work under the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). Internationally I am collaborating with the GlobalFinPrint project /Paul G Allen Philanthropies to coordinate with comparable global initiatives.
