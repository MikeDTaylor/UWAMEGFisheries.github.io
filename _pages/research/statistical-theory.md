We have applied novel methods to comparing body-size distributions. Working with students we have developed novel metrics of the effects of fishing based on fish body-size and behaviour, and contributed to a submitted manuscript lead by Rebecca Fisher of AIMS that developed R functions for conducting full sub-set multiple regression. We have a strong statistical emphasis in student supervision and demonstrate the importance of reproducible research.
