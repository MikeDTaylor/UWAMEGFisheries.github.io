## About me
I grew up in Perth and completed my Bachelor of Science in Physical and Analytical Chemistry with a second major in Marine Science at UWA in 2016. After finishing my undergraduate degree I decided that a chemistry lab wasn't for me. I began my Masters degree in Marine Biology in the second half of 2016, under the supervision of Dr. Tim Langlois, Dr. Jane Prince, Dr. Jordan Goetze, Dr. Joachim Claudet, and Dr. Lauric Thiault. I now work in the UWA Marine Ecology Group Fisheries research as a research assistant for Dr. Tim Langlois.
